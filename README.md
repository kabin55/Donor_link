# Donor Connect

## Bridging the Lifesaving Gap

The project is a platform that connects individuals in need of blood with potential donors. It allows users to request specific blood types and notifies registered donors nearby. The platform encourages participation by rewarding donors with points that can be redeemed for gifts, promoting a culture of life-saving generosity. Powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, the platform ensures secure, efficient, and real-time interactions for a seamless experience in bridging the gap between blood donors and recipients.
